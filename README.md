# RAG Demonstration with Llama

This project showcases the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** functionality using the **Llama** language model. The system enables users to upload PDFs, process their content, and store it in a database for efficient retrieval during inference. This demonstration provides a foundational workflow for leveraging external information in language model responses.

## Features
- **PDF Upload & Processing**: Extracts and stores document contents in a structured database.
- **Database Creation**: Stores processed text for efficient querying.
- **RAG-Based Retrieval**: Enhances Llamaâ€™s responses by integrating relevant external knowledge from uploaded PDFs.
- **Simple & Extendable**: This workflow serves as a demonstration of how RAG can be utilized in larger AI-driven projects.

## How It Works
1. Upload PDFs containing relevant information.
2. The system processes the PDFs and stores their content in a database.
3. When a query is made, the system retrieves relevant chunks from the database.
4. The retrieved information is used to augment the Llama modelâ€™s response.

## Use Case & Integration
This project demonstrates my approach to integrating **external knowledge sources** in AI applications. In more advanced projects, I utilize similar techniques to enhance **response accuracy, context-awareness, and reliability** when working with large-scale language models.

## Installation & Usage
Since this is a Jupyter Notebook, all required installations are included in the first code block. Simply run the notebook cells sequentially to set up the environment and execute the workflow.

## Requirements

A Hugging Face API Token is required to run this notebook. Ensure you have a valid token and set it up in your environment before execution.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional document formats (e.g., DOCX, TXT)
- Advanced chunking and embedding strategies for better retrieval
- Integration with vector databases for improved performance
